# NOTE [read this from Crytek](https://github.com/CRYTEK/CRYENGINE_ReadMe)
Instructions on getting started with git can be found [here](http://docs.cryengine.com/display/CEPROG/Getting+Started+with+git), along with details on working with launcher projects and git source code.

## Building

In order to compile, you will need to download the SDKs for the particular release you are trying to build. They can be found [here](https://github.com/CRYTEK-CRYENGINE/CRYENGINE/releases).

Extract the archive and move the SDK directory to the **Code** folder and rename it to **SDKs* [here](http://docs.cryengine.com/display/CEPROG/Getting+Started+with+WAF)
